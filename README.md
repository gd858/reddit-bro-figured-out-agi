i READ reddit post [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1glezjy/i_think_i_figured_out_how_to_build_agi_want_to/) and wanted to see what the author was claiming and if they were right. They had a pretty catchy title... 

*"I think i figured out how to build AGI. Want to get some feedback."*
* bold claim, wanted to give the author feedback

I downloaded the reddit thread using this web page [here](https://farnots.github.io/RedditToMarkdown/) and that is the reddit-thread.md file in this repo. 

I gave GPT 4-o the reddit thread file and asked simple questions to begin the process... 

The answers to my queries are shown below. I'll work on this more later, learning about this architectures might be fun. For now I guess I created a skeleton

# GPT Query 1

The Reddit post you shared outlines a speculative approach to building Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) based on principles from neuroscience and machine learning. Here are some key concepts from the discussion that might help you:

### Core Ideas
1. **Free Energy Principle (FEP)**: A theory suggesting that biological systems (like the human brain) minimize "surprise" or prediction error. The brain constantly adjusts its internal models to align with reality or takes actions to make reality fit its expectations.

2. **SMiRL (Surprise Minimizing Reinforcement Learning)**: A reinforcement learning approach that aims to minimize surprise. It works without explicit goals and shows how curiosity and exploration can emerge naturally from the objective of minimizing long-term surprise.

3. **Liquid Time Constant Neural Networks (LTCNs)**: These are neural networks with neurons that adapt their speed of change dynamically, allowing them to learn causality and perform well with fewer neurons compared to traditional networks. They generalize better and can learn tasks in different contexts.

4. **Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs)**: These networks mimic the brain's functionality by processing information through spikes, resembling the firing of neurons. The learning mechanism proposed is Spike Timing Dependent Plasticity (STDP), which adjusts connections based on the timing of spikes.

### Proposed AGI Model
The author suggests combining LTCNs with a surprise minimization learning rule, which would allow the network to learn in real time, without backpropagation, and become inherently exploratory and self-improving. The model is envisioned to:
- Learn autonomously and explore efficiently.
- Reduce training time significantly.
- Develop the ability to use language as a tool, enhancing its reasoning capabilities.

### Challenges and Criticisms
1. **Complexity of Human-Like Intelligence**: The brain's routines and methods of solving problems (like the ARC-AGI puzzles) are nuanced and hard to replicate in neural networks. Current models struggle with tasks requiring implicit problem-solving routines.

2. **Practical Limitations**: Implementing such an AGI framework would require novel data collection methods, like tracking eye movements, brain scans, and other human signals while solving problems.

3. **Skepticism from the Community**: Critics argue that existing models like transformers already incorporate elements of surprise minimization, and the proposed gains may be overstated without strong empirical evidence.

### Interesting Ideas for Exploration
- **Combining Vision and Language**: The suggestion to integrate real-world sensory data (e.g., video and audio) into training the network could make it more human-like in processing information.
- **Meta-Learning**: The concept that higher-level neurons in LTCNs could manage simpler routines to form complex behaviors and adapt to new tasks.

That's an exciting project to take on! Here's a structured approach to begin implementing and experimenting with the ideas from the post:

### 1. **Understand Key Components and Theories**
   - **Free Energy Principle**: Read more about the principle and how it relates to reinforcement learning and human cognition.
   - **Surprise Minimization**: Study how SMiRL operates and experiment with environments where reward signals are sparse.
   - **Liquid Time Constant Networks (LTCNs)**: Review the underlying math and implementation, understanding how they handle temporal data efficiently.
   - **Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs)**: Familiarize yourself with the basics of spiking neurons and STDP learning rules.

### 2. **Set Up a Basic Experiment**
   - **Environment**: Pick a simple yet meaningful simulation or game (e.g., CartPole, Atari games, or custom puzzles).
   - **Implementation**:
     1. **Start with SMiRL**: Implement a basic surprise-minimizing reinforcement learning agent.
     2. **Add Liquid Neural Networks**: Integrate LTCNs, making sure they can handle continuous data.
     3. **Incorporate SNNs**: Add spiking neurons and use an STDP-based learning rule to observe how they adapt in real time.
   - **Data Collection**: If you are interested in replicating human-like behavior, you might later consider recording human interactions with eye trackers or other sensors.

### 3. **Track Performance and Adjustments**
   - Measure how well the agent minimizes surprise and compare its performance to traditional reinforcement learning algorithms.
   - Experiment with different reward structures and explore how curiosity and exploration emerge.
   - If possible, evaluate the model on novel tasks or use few-shot learning scenarios to see if it generalizes.

### 4. **Refinement and Scaling**
   - Experiment with different neural architectures and see how they handle more complex environments.
   - Test the model's ability to learn and adapt in real-time environments.
   - Compare your findings with state-of-the-art models like transformers to assess if there are significant benefits.

Would you like to start with a specific model (e.g., SMiRL or LTCNs), or would you prefer to discuss any implementation details before jumping in?

Let's break down these key concepts in more detail to establish a strong understanding:

---

### 1. **Free Energy Principle (FEP)**
- **Concept**: The Free Energy Principle, proposed by Karl Friston, suggests that living organisms act to minimize the difference between their predicted states and the actual states they experience (i.e., minimize surprise or prediction error). The brain is thought to be a Bayesian inference engine, continuously updating its internal model of the world.
- **Relation to Reinforcement Learning**: 
  - In reinforcement learning (RL), an agent learns to take actions that maximize its expected reward. However, under the FEP, the focus shifts to minimizing surprise. 
  - You can think of surprise as the negative log probability of an outcome, similar to a loss function in RL. Thus, minimizing surprise is conceptually linked to maximizing expected rewards.
- **Applications**: The principle underlies theories of perception and action. In a robotic context, this could mean an agent continuously adapting its internal model of the environment to make better predictions or taking actions to make the environment more predictable.

**Next Steps**:
- Read about the mathematical formulation of the FEP and its implications in predictive coding.
- Look into how this principle is used to develop biologically inspired RL agents.

### 2. **Surprise Minimization and SMiRL**
- **SMiRL Overview**: Surprise Minimizing Reinforcement Learning (SMiRL) is an RL algorithm where the goal is to minimize long-term surprise. This can lead to emergent behaviors like exploration and imitation, even without explicitly defined goals.
- **Key Concepts**:
  - **Sparse Reward Environments**: SMiRL is particularly effective in environments where rewards are sparse or infrequent. By focusing on minimizing surprise, the agent learns useful behaviors that may indirectly increase the likelihood of reward.
  - **Emergent Exploration**: An agent using SMiRL might explore more effectively to reduce uncertainty about its environment. For instance, exploring a new area might increase short-term surprise but help reduce long-term surprise once the area is understood.
- **Implementation**:
  - Use environments from OpenAI Gym or custom scenarios where surprises (e.g., unpredictable events) can be easily defined.
  - Analyze how the agent balances exploration and exploitation, and whether it develops curiosity-like behavior.

**Next Steps**:
- Review the SMiRL paper and code implementations to see how surprise minimization is used as an intrinsic reward.
- Experiment with basic environments and observe the agent's behavior.

### 3. **Liquid Time Constant Networks (LTCNs)**
- **Concept**: LTCNs are a form of recurrent neural network (RNN) that dynamically adapt the time constants of their neurons. Each neuron in an LTCN can have a different, adaptive time constant, allowing the network to model temporal dependencies more effectively.
- **Key Advantages**:
  - **Efficiency**: LTCNs use fewer neurons while achieving similar or better performance compared to traditional RNNs.
  - **Causality Learning**: The adaptive time constants allow the network to learn the true causal relationships in sequential data, improving generalization.
- **Mathematics**: The differential equations governing LTCNs describe how each neuronâ€™s state evolves over time, influenced by its input and internal time constant.
- **Applications**: LTCNs have shown promise in tasks like autonomous driving, where they efficiently process continuous sensory data.

**Next Steps**:
- Study the original Liquid Time Constant Networks paper to understand the underlying math.
- Implement a simple LTCN model in PyTorch or TensorFlow and test it on temporal datasets, like sequential data from sensors or time-series predictions.

---

### 4. **Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) and STDP**
- **Spiking Neurons**: Unlike traditional artificial neurons that output continuous values, spiking neurons emit discrete spikes. This is closer to how biological neurons communicate.
- **Spike Timing Dependent Plasticity (STDP)**:
  - **Concept**: STDP is a biologically inspired learning rule where the strength of a connection between neurons (synapse) is adjusted based on the relative timing of spikes. If a presynaptic neuron fires just before a postsynaptic neuron, the synapse is strengthened (long-term potentiation). If it fires afterward, the synapse is weakened (long-term depression).
  - **Mathematical Model**: STDP rules are often modeled as a function of the time difference between presynaptic and postsynaptic spikes.
- **Applications**: SNNs are used in neuromorphic computing, where power efficiency is critical. They also offer potential for real-time learning and inference, similar to how the brain learns from sensory input.

**Next Steps**:
- Explore simulation frameworks like NEST or Brian2 for modeling SNNs.
- Implement a simple SNN and use STDP to train it on a task like pattern recognition.
